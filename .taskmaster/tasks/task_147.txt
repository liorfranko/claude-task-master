# Task ID: 147
# Title: Verify AI Task Generation System with Standardized Test Case
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 139, 140, 145
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create and execute a standardized test case to verify that the AI task generation system is working correctly and producing properly formatted task outputs.
# Details:
1. Design a standardized test case with the following components:
   - Use the exact prompt "Test task to verify AI is working correctly" as input
   - Document the expected output structure (JSON with title, description, details, testStrategy, and dependencies)
   - Define acceptance criteria for a successful test (proper JSON structure, reasonable content in each field, appropriate dependencies)

2. Execute the test case:
   - Run the AI task generation command with the standardized test input
   - Capture the complete output including any logs or error messages
   - Save the generated task JSON for analysis

3. Validate the results:
   - Verify the output is valid JSON and matches the expected schema
   - Check that all required fields are present and properly formatted
   - Ensure the content is coherent and relevant to the test prompt
   - Validate that dependencies are appropriate and reference existing tasks
   - Compare against previous test results if available to identify any changes in behavior

4. Document the test results:
   - Create a test report with timestamp, input, output, and validation results
   - Note any discrepancies or issues found during testing
   - Add screenshots or logs as needed for documentation
   - Store the test results in a designated location for future reference

5. Implement automated verification:
   - Create a script that can automatically run this test and validate results
   - Include validation checks for all required fields and format requirements
   - Add the script to the project's test suite for regular execution

# Test Strategy:
1. Manual Test Execution:
   - Execute the AI task generation command with the exact prompt "Test task to verify AI is working correctly"
   - Verify the command completes without errors
   - Confirm the output is valid JSON with all required fields
   - Check that the content is coherent and relevant to the test prompt
   - Validate that any dependencies listed are appropriate

2. Schema Validation:
   - Parse the output JSON and validate against the task schema
   - Verify all required fields are present: title, description, details, testStrategy
   - Check that dependencies are provided as an array of numbers
   - Ensure no extraneous fields are included

3. Content Quality Assessment:
   - Review the title for clarity and conciseness
   - Verify the description accurately summarizes the task in 1-2 sentences
   - Confirm the details section provides comprehensive implementation guidance
   - Check that the testStrategy includes specific verification steps
   - Ensure dependencies are logically connected to the task

4. Automated Testing:
   - Run the automated test script that executes the standardized test
   - Verify the script correctly identifies valid/invalid outputs
   - Confirm test results are properly logged and reported

5. Regression Testing:
   - Compare results with previous test runs to identify any changes in AI behavior
   - Document any differences in output format or content quality
