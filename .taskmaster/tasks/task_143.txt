# Task ID: 143
# Title: Verify AI Task Generation System with Simple Test Case
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 139, 140
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create and execute a simple test case to verify that the AI task generation system is working correctly and producing properly formatted task outputs.
# Details:
1. Design a simple test case that will validate the core functionality of the AI task generation system:
   - Create a basic task request with minimal information (e.g., "Create a task to implement a login button")
   - The request should be straightforward but include enough detail to test AI comprehension
   - Prepare expected output format and content to compare against

2. Execute the test case:
   - Run the AI task generation command with the prepared test input
   - Capture the complete output including any intermediate steps
   - Document the system's response time and resource usage

3. Validate the results:
   - Verify that the generated task follows the correct JSON schema
   - Check that all required fields (title, description, details, testStrategy) are present and properly formatted
   - Ensure the task content is relevant to the input request
   - Confirm that dependencies are logically assigned (if applicable)
   - Validate that the AI has properly interpreted the request intent

4. Document findings:
   - Create a brief report documenting the test case, execution process, and results
   - Note any discrepancies between expected and actual output
   - Provide recommendations for improvements if necessary

5. If issues are found:
   - Identify the specific component causing the problem (input parsing, AI processing, output formatting)
   - Document the exact nature of the failure with examples
   - Suggest potential fixes or workarounds

# Test Strategy:
1. Prepare test environment:
   - Ensure the AI task generation system is properly configured
   - Verify API keys and credentials are valid
   - Clear any cached data that might affect test results

2. Execute verification steps:
   - Run the prepared test case with the command: `task-cli generate "Create a task to implement a login button"`
   - Capture the complete output including any error messages or warnings
   - Verify the command completes without errors

3. Validate output structure:
   - Confirm the output is valid JSON and follows the required schema
   - Verify all required fields are present (title, description, details, testStrategy)
   - Check that dependencies are correctly formatted as an array of numbers

4. Validate output content:
   - Ensure the generated task title is clear and concise
   - Verify the description accurately summarizes the requested functionality
   - Check that implementation details are comprehensive and relevant
   - Confirm the test strategy provides concrete verification steps
   - Validate that any dependencies make logical sense for the task

5. Document test results:
   - Create a test report with screenshots of the command execution and output
   - Note any deviations from expected behavior
   - Record system performance metrics (response time, resource usage)
   - Document the test date, time, and environment configuration

6. Regression test:
   - If previous test results exist, compare current output to ensure consistency
   - Verify that any previously identified issues have been resolved
