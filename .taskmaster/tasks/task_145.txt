# Task ID: 145
# Title: Verify AI Task Generation System with Simple Test Input
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 139, 140
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create and execute a basic test to verify that the AI task generation system is working correctly by using a simple test input and validating the output format.
# Details:
1. Prepare a simple test input:
   - Create a basic task request with minimal information: "Test task to verify AI is working correctly"
   - Document the expected output format (proper JSON structure with title, description, details, testStrategy, and dependencies fields)

2. Execute the test:
   - Run the AI task generation command with the prepared test input
   - Capture the generated task output
   - Save the raw response for analysis

3. Validate the output:
   - Verify the output is valid JSON and matches the expected schema
   - Check that all required fields are present and properly formatted
   - Ensure the title is appropriate and doesn't include the task ID
   - Confirm the description is concise but informative
   - Validate that the details section provides comprehensive implementation guidance
   - Check that the testStrategy section includes specific verification steps
   - Verify dependencies are correctly represented as an array of task IDs

4. Document the results:
   - Record whether the test passed or failed
   - Note any discrepancies between expected and actual output
   - Document any error messages or unexpected behavior
   - If successful, save the test case as a reference for future verification

5. Address any issues:
   - If the test fails, identify the specific problem areas
   - Check system logs for any error messages
   - Verify API connectivity and authentication
   - Ensure the AI prompt template is correctly formatted

# Test Strategy:
1. Prepare test environment:
   - Ensure the AI task generation system is properly configured
   - Verify API keys and authentication are set up correctly
   - Clear any cached data that might affect the test

2. Execute the test case:
   - Run the command: `./task-cli.js generate "Test task to verify AI is working correctly"`
   - Capture the complete output including any console messages

3. Validation checklist:
   - Output is valid JSON that can be parsed without errors
   - JSON structure matches the required schema (title, description, details, testStrategy, dependencies)
   - All required fields are present and non-empty
   - Title is appropriate and doesn't contain the task ID
   - Description is clear and concise (1-2 sentences)
   - Details section is comprehensive with multiple implementation steps
   - TestStrategy section includes specific verification steps
   - Dependencies array is present (even if empty)

4. Document test results:
   - Screenshot or copy the complete output
   - Note the date, time, and system configuration
   - Record any error messages or warnings
   - Document whether the test passed or failed based on the validation checklist

5. Verify with a second test input:
   - Run a second test with a slightly different input to ensure consistency
   - Compare the outputs to confirm the AI is responding appropriately to different inputs
