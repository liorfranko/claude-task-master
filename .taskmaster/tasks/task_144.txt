# Task ID: 144
# Title: Test AI Task Generation System Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 139, 140, 141
# Priority: medium
# Description: Execute a comprehensive test to verify that the AI task generation system is working correctly, including input processing, task creation, and output formatting.
# Details:
1. Prepare test environment:
   - Ensure the AI task generation system is properly configured
   - Verify API keys and credentials are set up correctly
   - Clear any existing test artifacts from previous runs

2. Create a test input scenario:
   - Use a simple, well-defined task request: "Create a task to implement a user profile page with basic information display"
   - This tests the AI's ability to understand requirements and generate appropriate implementation details

3. Execute the AI task generation:
   - Run the command: `npm run task:create "Create a task to implement a user profile page with basic information display"`
   - Capture the generated output including task ID, title, description, details, and dependencies
   - Monitor for any errors or warnings during execution

4. Validate the generated task:
   - Verify the task has been created with a valid ID
   - Check that the title is clear and concise
   - Ensure the description accurately reflects the request
   - Validate that implementation details are comprehensive and actionable
   - Confirm the test strategy is specific and verifiable
   - Check that dependencies are appropriate (should reference relevant existing tasks)

5. Test edge cases:
   - Try generating a task with minimal input: "Test task"
   - Test with complex requirements including multiple dependencies
   - Verify handling of special characters and formatting

6. Verify integration:
   - Confirm the generated task is properly saved to tasks.json
   - Check that the task can be retrieved using standard task operations
   - Ensure the task format matches the expected schema

7. Document results:
   - Record successful test cases and their outputs
   - Note any failures or unexpected behaviors
   - Create a summary report of the AI system's performance

# Test Strategy:
1. Pre-test verification:
   - Run `npm run task:list` to confirm the task management system is operational
   - Check that tasks.json exists and is properly formatted
   - Verify AI configuration by checking for API key presence

2. Execute primary test case:
   - Run: `npm run task:create "Create a task to implement a user profile page with basic information display"`
   - Expected output: A new task with ID 144 containing:
     * Clear title mentioning user profile page
     * Detailed implementation steps
     * Appropriate dependencies on existing tasks
     * Comprehensive test strategy

3. Validate task creation:
   - Run `npm run task:view 144` to display the created task
   - Verify all required fields are present and populated
   - Check that the task appears in `npm run task:list` output

4. Test task quality:
   - Review generated implementation details for completeness
   - Ensure test strategy is actionable and specific
   - Verify dependencies make logical sense

5. Edge case testing:
   - Create a minimal task: `npm run task:create "Test"`
   - Create a complex task with specific requirements
   - Verify both are handled appropriately

6. Integration testing:
   - Open tasks.json and verify the new task is properly formatted
   - Run `npm run task:update 144 --status in-progress` to test task modification
   - Confirm changes are persisted correctly

7. Success criteria:
   - AI generates valid, well-structured tasks
   - All required fields are populated appropriately
   - Tasks are saved correctly to the data store
   - No errors or exceptions during execution
   - Generated content is relevant and actionable
