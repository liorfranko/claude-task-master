# Task ID: 137
# Title: Validate Monday Sync in Real-World Scenarios
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 96, 123, 125, 129, 134
# Priority: high
# Description: Test the Monday.com synchronization process under real-world conditions to ensure reliability and correctness, including edge cases and performance under load.
# Details:
1. Set up a test environment with realistic data volumes and configurations to mimic production usage.
2. Execute the synchronization process (pull-from-Monday and push-to-Monday) under various conditions, such as:
   - High network latency or intermittent connectivity.
   - Large volumes of tasks (e.g., 1000+ tasks).
   - Concurrent sync operations from multiple users.
3. Monitor system logs, performance metrics, and error rates to identify bottlenecks or anomalies.
4. Validate task mappings, status conversions, and data integrity after each sync operation.
5. Test edge cases, such as:
   - Tasks with missing or invalid fields.
   - Sync conflicts (e.g., simultaneous updates in Monday.com and the local system).
   - Offline mode and subsequent reconnection.
6. Document findings and provide recommendations for improvements or fixes.

# Test Strategy:
1. Use automated test scripts to simulate real-world scenarios, including load testing and edge cases.
2. Manually verify synchronization results for correctness, including task fields, statuses, and relationships.
3. Monitor system performance metrics (e.g., sync duration, API call latency) and ensure they meet acceptable thresholds.
4. Validate error handling and recovery by intentionally introducing failures (e.g., network drops, API rate limits).
5. Cross-check logs and reports to ensure all sync operations are logged and traceable.
