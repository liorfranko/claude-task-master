# Task ID: 141
# Title: Verify AI Task Generation System End-to-End
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 139, 140
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing of the AI task generation system to ensure it correctly processes inputs and produces properly formatted task outputs.
# Details:
1. Create a test suite with the following scenarios:
   - Simple task creation with minimal information
   - Complex task with detailed requirements and multiple dependencies
   - Edge cases (very long descriptions, special characters, unusual formatting)
   - Tasks with varying priorities and statuses
   - Tasks requiring specific dependency relationships

2. For each test scenario:
   - Document the expected output format and content
   - Execute the AI task generation command with appropriate inputs
   - Compare the generated output against expected results
   - Document any discrepancies or unexpected behaviors

3. Test the integration points:
   - Verify that generated tasks are properly stored in the tasks.json structure
   - Confirm that task IDs are correctly assigned without conflicts
   - Test that dependencies are properly established and validated
   - Ensure all required fields are populated with appropriate content

4. Perform regression testing:
   - Verify that existing functionality continues to work after AI integration
   - Test that the AI system doesn't interfere with manual task creation
   - Confirm that task operations (update, delete, list) work with AI-generated tasks

5. Document the testing process and results:
   - Create a test report with findings
   - Document any bugs or issues discovered
   - Provide recommendations for improvements if needed

# Test Strategy:
1. Prepare test environment:
   - Ensure the system is in a known good state
   - Create a backup of the tasks.json file before testing
   - Set up logging to capture all system interactions

2. Execute automated test suite:
   - Run a script that generates tasks with various inputs
   - Capture all outputs and system responses
   - Compare outputs against expected results using automated validation

3. Manual verification:
   - Visually inspect generated tasks for proper formatting and content
   - Verify that task dependencies are logically sound
   - Check that all required fields contain appropriate information
   - Ensure descriptions and details are coherent and useful

4. Integration testing:
   - Verify that AI-generated tasks appear correctly in task listings
   - Test updating AI-generated tasks
   - Confirm that dependency relationships work correctly
   - Test task completion workflow with AI-generated tasks

5. Acceptance criteria:
   - All test cases pass with expected outputs
   - No errors or exceptions during task generation
   - Generated tasks follow the correct format and structure
   - Task content is coherent and matches input requirements
   - System performance remains within acceptable parameters
