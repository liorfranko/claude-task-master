# Task ID: 139
# Title: Verify AI Task Generation Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Test and validate that the AI-powered task generation system is working correctly by creating test tasks and verifying the output matches expected format and quality.
# Details:
1. Review the existing AI task generation implementation to understand how tasks are created and processed.
2. Create a set of test scenarios with varying complexity:
   - Simple task creation with minimal information
   - Complex task with detailed requirements and dependencies
   - Edge cases (very long descriptions, special characters, etc.)
3. For each test scenario:
   - Submit the task creation request through the appropriate interface
   - Capture the AI-generated output
   - Compare against expected format and content quality
4. Verify that the AI correctly:
   - Generates appropriate titles that are concise and descriptive
   - Creates detailed implementation steps in the details section
   - Provides comprehensive test strategies
   - Correctly identifies and assigns dependencies based on task relationships
5. Document any discrepancies or issues found during testing
6. Make recommendations for improvements to the AI task generation process if needed

The test should focus on both technical correctness (proper JSON format, valid dependencies) and qualitative aspects (helpful content, appropriate level of detail).

# Test Strategy:
1. Create a test harness that can submit task creation requests and capture the AI responses
2. Define a set of expected outputs or quality criteria for each test case
3. Execute the following test cases:
   - Basic task: "Create a task to add user authentication"
   - Complex task: "Implement a database migration system with rollback capability"
   - Edge case: Submit an extremely detailed multi-paragraph requirement
   - Dependency test: Create a task that should logically depend on existing tasks
4. For each test case, evaluate:
   - JSON structure validity
   - Presence of all required fields
   - Quality of generated content (details, test strategy)
   - Appropriateness of identified dependencies
5. Create a test report documenting:
   - Pass/fail status for each test case
   - Specific issues identified
   - Examples of good and problematic outputs
   - Recommendations for improvement
6. Verify the AI can handle updates to existing tasks as well as creation of new tasks
7. Test the system's response to invalid or ambiguous inputs
