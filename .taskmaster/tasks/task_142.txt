# Task ID: 142
# Title: Verify AI Task Generation with Test Case
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 139, 140
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create and execute a simple test case to verify that the AI task generation system is functioning correctly and producing properly formatted output.
# Details:
1. Design a simple test case that will validate the core functionality of the AI task generation system:
   - Create a basic task request with minimal information
   - The request should be straightforward but include enough detail to test AI comprehension
   - Example prompt: "Create a task to implement a basic user login form"

2. Execute the test case:
   - Run the AI task generation command with the test prompt
   - Capture the complete output including any logs or debug information
   - Document the system's response time and resource usage

3. Analyze the results:
   - Verify that the generated task has all required fields (title, description, details, testStrategy)
   - Check that the content is relevant to the prompt and makes logical sense
   - Ensure dependencies are appropriately assigned if applicable
   - Confirm the format adheres to the task data structure schema

4. Document findings:
   - Create a brief report documenting the test execution and results
   - Note any discrepancies or unexpected behavior
   - Include recommendations for improvements if necessary

5. If issues are found:
   - Identify the specific component that may be causing the problem
   - Check API connectivity if the response is missing or malformed
   - Verify that the task formatting logic is working correctly
   - Ensure the AI prompt engineering is effective

# Test Strategy:
1. Prepare test environment:
   - Ensure the system has proper API credentials configured
   - Verify network connectivity to the AI service
   - Clear any cached data that might affect test results

2. Execute verification steps:
   - Run the command: `./task-cli.js ai create "Create a task to implement a basic user login form"`
   - Capture the complete output including any error messages
   - Verify the command completes without errors

3. Validate the generated task:
   - Confirm the task is added to tasks.json with a valid ID
   - Verify all required fields are present and properly formatted
   - Check that the content is coherent and relevant to the prompt
   - Ensure the task follows the established schema

4. Perform format validation:
   - Validate the JSON structure of the generated task
   - Confirm that dependencies are correctly formatted as an array of numbers
   - Verify that the description is concise (1-2 sentences)
   - Ensure the details section contains comprehensive implementation guidance

5. Document test results:
   - Record the test execution date, time, and environment details
   - Document any issues encountered and their resolution
   - Save the generated task as a reference for future testing
