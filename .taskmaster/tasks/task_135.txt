# Task ID: 135
# Title: Verify Monday Sync Functionality in Production Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 96, 123, 125, 129, 131, 133, 134
# Priority: high
# Description: Test and validate the Monday.com synchronization process in a production-like environment to ensure reliability and correctness.
# Details:
1. Set up a production-like environment with realistic data volumes and configurations.
2. Execute the Monday.com synchronization process (pull-from-Monday and push-to-Monday) multiple times under varying conditions (e.g., network latency, high load).
3. Monitor system logs and performance metrics to identify any anomalies or bottlenecks.
4. Validate that all task mappings, status conversions, and conflict resolutions work as expected.
5. Test edge cases, such as partial sync failures, API rate limits, and offline scenarios.
6. Document any issues found and work with the development team to resolve them.
7. Ensure that the sync status commands (from Task 131) provide accurate feedback during and after sync operations.

# Test Strategy:
1. Use automated test scripts to simulate sync operations with different data sets and conditions.
2. Manually verify the correctness of synced tasks by comparing them between Monday.com and the local system.
3. Check system logs for errors or warnings during and after sync operations.
4. Measure sync performance metrics (e.g., duration, resource usage) to ensure they meet acceptable thresholds.
5. Verify that error handling and recovery mechanisms (from Task 133) function as expected during failures.
6. Confirm that sync status commands (from Task 131) display accurate and up-to-date information.
