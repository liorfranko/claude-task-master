# Task ID: 146
# Title: Verify AI Task Generation System with Standard Test Input
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 139, 140
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create and execute a standardized test to verify that the AI task generation system is working correctly by using a predefined test input and validating the output format and content.
# Details:
1. Prepare a standardized test input:
   - Use the exact phrase "Test task to verify AI is working correctly" as the input prompt
   - Document the expected output structure (JSON with title, description, details, testStrategy, and dependencies fields)
   - Define acceptance criteria for a successful test:
     * Output must be valid JSON
     * All required fields must be present
     * Content must be relevant to the input prompt
     * Dependencies must be logically structured

2. Execute the test:
   - Run the AI task generation command with the standardized test input
   - Capture the complete response including any error messages
   - Save the output to a test results file with timestamp

3. Validate the results:
   - Parse the JSON output to verify structural integrity
   - Check that all required fields are present and properly formatted
   - Verify the content is coherent and relevant to the test prompt
   - Ensure dependencies are appropriate based on the task context
   - Compare against previous test results if available

4. Document the test results:
   - Create a test report with pass/fail status
   - Include any anomalies or unexpected behavior
   - Document response time and any performance metrics
   - Store the report in the project's test documentation

5. Implement as a repeatable test:
   - Create a script that can run this test automatically
   - Add the test to the project's test suite for regression testing
   - Ensure the test can be run as part of CI/CD processes

# Test Strategy:
1. Manual Verification:
   - Execute the AI task generation command with the exact input "Test task to verify AI is working correctly"
   - Manually inspect the output JSON to verify:
     * All required fields are present (title, description, details, testStrategy, dependencies)
     * Content is coherent and relevant to the test prompt
     * Dependencies are logically structured
   - Document any issues or anomalies

2. Automated Testing:
   - Run the automated test script that executes the standardized test
   - Verify the script correctly identifies whether the output meets all requirements
   - Check that the test results are properly logged and stored

3. Regression Testing:
   - Compare the current test results with previous results
   - Verify that any previously identified issues have been resolved
   - Ensure no new issues have been introduced

4. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test the system's response to variations of the standard input
   - Verify the system handles minor modifications gracefully
   - Document how the AI adapts to different phrasings of the same request

5. Integration Verification:
   - Confirm the generated task can be properly added to the tasks.json file
   - Verify the task appears correctly in task listings and reports
   - Ensure the task can be manipulated with standard task operations (update, delete, etc.)

The test is considered successful when:
1. The AI generates a properly formatted JSON response
2. All required fields contain relevant and coherent content
3. The task can be integrated into the task management system
4. The test can be repeated with consistent results
