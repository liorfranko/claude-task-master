# Task ID: 111
# Title: Implement Hybrid Storage Provider
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 108, 110
# Priority: medium
# Description: The hybrid storage provider has been fully implemented and exceeds the original requirements. It provides a robust, event-driven solution for hybrid persistence, supporting all CRUD and subtask operations, advanced conflict resolution, and seamless integration with both local storage and Monday.com.
# Details:
Implementation summary:

- `scripts/modules/storage/hybrid-storage-provider.js` (508 lines):
  - Fully implements the persistence manager interface
  - Writes to both local storage and Monday.com
  - Uses HybridSyncEngine for conflict resolution
  - Handles partial failures gracefully
  - Maintains sync state and timestamps
  - Supports all CRUD operations (getTasks, getTask, createTask, updateTask, deleteTask)
  - Supports subtask operations (getSubtasks, createSubtask, updateSubtask, deleteSubtask)
  - Event-driven architecture with robust error handling

- `scripts/modules/hybrid-sync-engine.js` (588 lines):
  - Bidirectional sync between local and Monday.com
  - Conflict detection and resolution (manual, local-wins, monday-wins, newest-wins)
  - Sync state tracking with timestamps
  - Auto-sync capability with configurable intervals
  - Partial failure recovery
  - Event emission for sync status

- `scripts/modules/storage/index.js`:
  - Hybrid provider is registered with the persistence manager
  - Initialization and factory logic are in place

The codebase uses ES6 modules, modern JavaScript patterns, and provides advanced monitoring and error recovery. All requirements from the original specification are met or exceeded.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests with mock providers (completed)
2. All CRUD and subtask operations tested in hybrid mode (completed)
3. Offline and partial failure scenarios tested (completed)
4. Conflict detection and all resolution strategies tested (completed)
5. Integration tested with real Monday.com API (test board 9275265350) (completed)
6. Performance tested with large task sets (completed)
7. Event emission and recovery mechanisms verified (completed)
