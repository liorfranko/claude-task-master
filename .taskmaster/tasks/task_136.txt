# Task ID: 136
# Title: Monitor and Optimize Monday Sync Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 96, 123, 125, 134
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement performance monitoring and optimization for the Monday.com synchronization process to ensure efficient and reliable operation.
# Details:
1. Integrate performance monitoring tools (e.g., logging, metrics collection) into the Monday sync engine (`scripts/modules/monday-sync.js`).
2. Identify and address bottlenecks in the synchronization process, such as API rate limits, network latency, or inefficient data mapping.
3. Optimize the pull-from-Monday and push-to-Monday operations by batching requests, caching responses, and reducing redundant API calls.
4. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed sync operations.
5. Add performance metrics (e.g., sync duration, success/failure rates) to the sync status reporting system.
6. Document performance benchmarks and optimization strategies for future reference.

# Test Strategy:
1. Execute the sync process under varying conditions (e.g., high load, network latency) and monitor performance metrics.
2. Verify that optimizations (e.g., batching, caching) reduce sync duration and API usage.
3. Test retry logic by simulating API failures and ensuring sync operations recover gracefully.
4. Validate that performance metrics are accurately reported in the sync status commands.
5. Compare performance before and after optimizations to confirm improvements.
