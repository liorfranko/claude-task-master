# Task ID: 134
# Title: Ensure Monday Sync Functionality Works Properly
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 96, 123, 125, 129, 131
# Priority: high
# Description: Verify and debug the Monday.com synchronization process to ensure it works correctly, including pull-from-Monday and push-to-Monday operations.
# Details:
1. Review the existing sync engine implementation in `scripts/modules/monday-sync.js` to ensure all pull-from-Monday and push-to-Monday operations are functioning as expected.
2. Test the synchronization process with various scenarios, including:
   - New tasks created in Monday.com and pulled to the local system.
   - Tasks updated in Monday.com and synced to the local system.
   - Tasks created or updated locally and pushed to Monday.com.
   - Conflict scenarios where the same task is modified in both systems.
3. Debug any issues found during testing, focusing on:
   - Field mapping between Task Master and Monday.com.
   - Status conversion logic.
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms.
4. Ensure the sync status commands (implemented in Task 131) provide accurate feedback during and after sync operations.
5. Validate that the local cache (implemented in Task 129) is correctly updated during sync operations.
6. Document any fixes or improvements made to the sync process.

# Test Strategy:
1. Execute the sync process using the CLI commands from Task 98 and verify the output.
2. Use the sync status commands from Task 131 to monitor the sync process.
3. Manually inspect the local and Monday.com task lists to confirm synchronization accuracy.
4. Simulate network failures or API errors to test error handling and recovery.
5. Verify conflict resolution by modifying the same task in both systems and observing the resolution process.
6. Check logs for any unexpected errors or warnings during sync operations.
