# Task ID: 7
# Title: Update Task Creation and Modification Functions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify existing task creation and modification functions to use the Monday.com persistence layer.
# Details:
Update all task creation and modification functions to use the Monday.com persistence layer instead of local file operations. Modify functions in the task-manager module including add-task.js, update-task.js, and delete-task.js. Replace calls to readJSON() and writeJSON() with the corresponding Monday.com persistence functions. Update parameter validation to account for Monday.com constraints. Ensure backward compatibility for projects still using local persistence. Add proper error handling for network-related issues. Optimize for performance by minimizing API calls and using batch operations where possible. Update return values to handle asynchronous operations correctly.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for all modified functions with mocked Monday.com persistence. Test with various task structures and quantities. Verify error handling for network issues. Test backward compatibility with local persistence mode. Create integration tests with a test Monday.com account to verify actual behavior. Compare results with the existing implementation to ensure feature parity.
