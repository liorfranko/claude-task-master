# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Monday Persistence Core Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core persistence module that replaces local file operations with Monday.com API calls.
# Details:
Develop the `monday-persistence.js` module that implements all core persistence functions specified in the PRD: `saveTasks()`, `loadTasks()`, `saveTask()`, `deleteTask()`, `updateTaskStatus()`, and `createSubtask()`. This module will serve as a direct replacement for the current file-based persistence layer. Use the Monday.com API client for all API interactions and the data transformation layer to convert between data formats. Implement intelligent caching to minimize API calls and improve performance. Handle pagination for large task lists (Monday.com API limits). Implement proper error handling and retry logic for failed operations. Support both synchronous and asynchronous operation patterns to maintain compatibility with existing code. Add telemetry for monitoring performance and detecting issues.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for all persistence functions with mocked API responses. Test with various task structures and quantities. Verify error handling and recovery mechanisms. Test performance with large task lists. Create integration tests with a test Monday.com account to verify actual persistence behavior. Compare results with the existing file-based persistence to ensure feature parity.
