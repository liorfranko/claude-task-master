# Task ID: 110
# Title: Implement Sync Engine for Hybrid Mode
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 108
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a robust synchronization engine that manages bidirectional sync between local storage and Monday.com in hybrid mode, using the new consolidated configuration structure and supporting all required sync features.
# Details:
The hybrid sync engine is now fully implemented and located at `scripts/modules/hybrid-sync-engine.js`. It provides:

- Bidirectional sync logic between local and Monday.com
- Conflict detection and resolution (manual, local-wins, monday-wins, newest-wins)
- Sync state tracking with timestamps
- Event-driven architecture (e.g., conflictDetected, syncCompleted)
- Auto-sync capability with a default 5-minute interval (configurable via code)
- Sync-on-write for immediate consistency
- Comprehensive error handling and partial failure recovery
- Status reporting and statistics

Configuration is now managed exclusively via `persistence.hybridConfig` for all sync-related settings. The relevant configuration structure is:

```json
{
  "persistence": {
    "mode": "local|monday|hybrid",
    "hybridConfig": {
      "primaryProvider": "local|monday",
      "conflictResolution": "manual|local-wins|monday-wins|newest-wins",
      "autoSync": false,
      "syncOnWrite": true
    }
  },
  "mondayIntegration": {
    "boardId": null,
    "apiToken": null,
    "columnMapping": { ... }
  }
}
```

All sync configuration is accessed and validated via helper functions in `config-manager.js`. The sync engine is integrated with the storage layer (`scripts/modules/storage/hybrid-storage-provider.js`) and provider registration (`scripts/modules/storage/index.js`).

The previous `syncSettings` property under `mondayIntegration` has been removed to avoid duplication. The `syncInterval` is now hardcoded to 5 minutes by default. All configuration changes should be made in `persistence.hybridConfig`.

The engine is ready for comprehensive testing, including unit, integration, and performance scenarios.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for sync logic with mock providers
2. Test conflict detection and all resolution strategies (manual, local-wins, monday-wins, newest-wins)
3. Test partial sync failures and recovery
4. Test with real Monday.com API using test board 9275265350
5. Test performance with large task sets and many conflicts
6. Test edge cases such as deleted tasks in one system
7. Validate event emission (conflictDetected, syncCompleted, etc.)
8. Verify configuration defaults and error handling for misconfiguration
