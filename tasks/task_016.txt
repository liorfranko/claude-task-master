Implement an offline mode that allows working without internet connectivity. Create a local cache of Monday.com data for offline use. Implement change tracking to record modifications made while offline. Add network connectivity detection to automatically switch between online and offline modes. Create a sync-on-reconnect system that synchronizes offline changes when connectivity is restored. Implement conflict resolution for changes made both offline and online. Add user notifications for sync status and conflicts. Create a manual sync trigger for user-controlled synchronization. Implement logging of offline operations and sync events.

# Test Strategy:
Test offline mode with various network connectivity scenarios. Verify local cache works correctly for offline use. Test change tracking for offline modifications. Test automatic mode switching based on connectivity. Test sync-on-reconnect with various change scenarios. Test conflict resolution for concurrent changes. Test user notifications for sync status and conflicts. Test manual sync trigger. Create integration tests with simulated network conditions to verify actual offline behavior.
