# Task ID: 32
# Title: Verify Monday Sync Stability and Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 31
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct comprehensive verification that the Monday.com synchronization is functioning reliably and efficiently after recent fixes and improvements.
# Details:
Execute a thorough validation of the Monday.com synchronization functionality to confirm it is working properly and consistently. This involves running extended test scenarios that stress-test the sync mechanisms, including bulk operations, concurrent access patterns, and edge cases that could cause synchronization failures. Test data consistency by creating, updating, and deleting multiple tasks in rapid succession, then verifying that all changes are properly reflected on Monday.com boards. Monitor API response times and error rates to ensure performance meets acceptable thresholds. Validate that the sync handles network interruptions gracefully with proper retry mechanisms. Test schema validation during sync operations to ensure data integrity is maintained. Run automated sync tests for at least 30 minutes to identify any intermittent issues or memory leaks. Document any performance bottlenecks or areas for optimization. Verify that error logging provides sufficient detail for troubleshooting sync issues in production environments.

# Test Strategy:
Execute a multi-phase testing approach: 1) Run the automated test suite from Task 30 to establish baseline functionality, 2) Perform manual stress testing with 50+ concurrent task operations to verify sync stability under load, 3) Test network resilience by simulating connection drops during sync operations, 4) Validate data consistency by comparing local task state with Monday.com board data after various operations, 5) Monitor system resources (memory, CPU) during extended sync sessions, 6) Test error recovery by intentionally triggering API rate limits and verifying graceful handling, 7) Verify sync performance meets SLA requirements (< 2 seconds for single task operations, < 30 seconds for bulk operations), 8) Document all test results with timestamps, error logs, and performance metrics for future reference.
