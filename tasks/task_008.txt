# Task ID: 8
# Title: Update Status Management Functions
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify task status management functions to use the Monday.com persistence layer and status column.
# Details:
Update all status management functions to use the Monday.com persistence layer. Modify functions that change task status to use the updateTaskStatus() function from the Monday persistence module. Implement mapping between Task Master status values (pending, in-progress, done, blocked, deferred, cancelled) and Monday.com status column values. Update group management to move items between groups based on status changes. Ensure status changes trigger appropriate webhook notifications. Add optimistic UI updates for status changes to improve perceived performance. Implement proper error handling and recovery for failed status updates. Maintain backward compatibility for projects using local persistence.

# Test Strategy:
Test status changes for all possible status values. Verify group movement works correctly. Test error handling for failed status updates. Verify webhook notifications are triggered correctly. Test backward compatibility with local persistence mode. Create integration tests with a test Monday.com account to verify actual status management behavior.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Monday.com Persistence Layer [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refactor all status management functions to use the Monday.com persistence layer for reading and writing status data.
### Details:
Replace local storage or custom persistence logic with Monday.com's key-value storage and GraphQL API for all status-related operations.
<info added on 2025-05-31T21:17:29.197Z>
Monday.com status management integration is now fully implemented, replacing all local storage and custom persistence logic with Monday.com's key-value storage and GraphQL API for status-related operations. The new system features dual-mode support for seamless switching between Monday.com and local persistence, comprehensive bidirectional status mapping, automatic group management, transition validation, optimistic updates, performance optimizations, and telemetry tracking. Enhanced integration with set-task-status.js ensures automatic mode detection, multi-task support, advanced options, robust error handling, and backward compatibility. The solution supports six status mappings, four group categories, configurable transition rules, status caching, dependency integration, and preparatory webhook support, making the status management system production-ready and fully aligned with Monday.com best practices.

## 2. Implement Status Value Mapping [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create and maintain a mapping between Task Master status values and Monday.com status column values.
### Details:
Define a translation layer or mapping object to ensure Task Master statuses (pending, in-progress, done, blocked, deferred, cancelled) correspond to the correct Monday.com status column values.

## Status Value Mapping Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

Successfully implemented a robust, production-ready bidirectional status mapping system between Task Master and Monday.com, featuring:

- Dedicated status mapping module (`monday-status-mapping.js`) supporting 7 core Task Master statuses and 15+ Monday.com status variations.
- Priority-based mapping with color coding and visual representation for priority levels 1-7.
- Support for multiple group mappings (DEFAULT, KANBAN, SPRINT) and customizable group structures.
- Advanced transition rules with configurable validation, automatic and restricted transitions, and fallback mechanisms for unmapped statuses.
- Custom mapping overlays and runtime configuration updates.
- StatusMappingManager class with input validation, telemetry tracking, dynamic configuration, case-insensitive processing, and optimized performance.
- Enhanced integration with the Monday.com Status Manager, providing unified interface, improved error handling, combined telemetry, backward compatibility, and rich metadata in status updates.
- Comprehensive translation capabilities for Task Master ↔ Monday.com, including group management and visual priority mapping.
- Full support for mapping exact status values and syncing changes in both directions, addressing the need for precise status correspondence between platforms[1][2][3].

## 3. Update Status Change Functions [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Modify all functions that change task status to use the updateTaskStatus() function from the Monday persistence module.
### Details:
Ensure all status updates go through the unified updateTaskStatus() interface, applying the mapping and persistence logic.
<info added on 2025-05-31T21:24:44.294Z>
The Monday.com Status API integration has been successfully implemented. All status updates now flow through the unified updateTaskStatus() interface which properly maps our internal status values to Monday.com's status column values. The implementation uses the GraphQL API with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms.

Key technical details:
- Implemented POST requests to Monday.com's GraphQL API endpoint for status updates
- Added status column validation to ensure compatibility with Monday.com's status options
- Created bidirectional mapping between our status values and Monday.com's status column values
- Implemented cursor-based pagination for handling large datasets when needed
- Added version header management to ensure API compatibility
- Built comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation to local persistence when API calls fail

The system now properly handles both direct status assignments and transitions through the Monday.com Status Manager, maintaining data consistency between our application and Monday.com boards.

## 4. Enhance Group Management and Webhook Notifications [done]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Update group management logic to move items between groups based on status changes and trigger appropriate webhook notifications.
### Details:
Implement logic to move tasks between Monday.com groups when their status changes and ensure webhook events are fired for external integrations.

## 5. Implement Optimistic UI Updates and Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Add optimistic UI updates for status changes, implement error handling and recovery for failed updates, and maintain backward compatibility for local persistence.
### Details:
Ensure the UI reflects status changes immediately, handle errors gracefully with rollback or retry logic, and support legacy projects using local persistence.
