# Task ID: 28
# Title: Test Monday Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 4, 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct a comprehensive test of the Monday.com integration to ensure all implemented modules interact correctly and data flows seamlessly between the application and Monday.com.
# Details:
Perform integration testing by exercising all major workflows that utilize the Monday.com API client, board manager, and persistence modules. This includes creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting tasks on Monday.com boards, verifying schema compliance, and ensuring error handling works as expected. Simulate real-world usage scenarios, such as concurrent updates, invalid data submissions, and network interruptions, to validate robustness. Use both API-level tools (e.g., Postman) and UI automation (e.g., Selenium) to test end-to-end flows, including authentication, data synchronization, and workflow triggers. Document all test cases, expected outcomes, and any issues encountered. Follow Monday.com integration best practices, such as queuing API requests and handling rate limits gracefully, to ensure stability and compliance with platform guidelines.

# Test Strategy:
1. Prepare a dedicated Monday.com test board with the required schema. 2. Use API testing tools to create, update, and delete tasks via the integration, verifying responses and board state after each operation. 3. Employ UI automation to simulate user interactions and workflow triggers within Monday.com, ensuring the integration responds correctly. 4. Test error scenarios, such as invalid data and API rate limits, and confirm the integration handles them gracefully. 5. Review logs and Monday.com board state to ensure all operations are reflected accurately. 6. Document results and confirm all test cases pass without regressions.
