# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Data Transformation Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create utility functions to transform between Task Master data structures and Monday.com item representations.
# Details:
Implement a data transformation layer in `monday-data-transformer.js` that handles bidirectional conversion between Task Master task objects and Monday.com items. Create functions: `transformTaskToMondayColumns(task)` to convert task properties to Monday column values, `transformMondayItemToTask(item, schema)` to convert Monday items back to task objects, `transformMondayItemsToTasks(items, schema)` for batch conversions, and `validateTransformedData(original, transformed)` to ensure data integrity during transformations. Handle special cases like dependencies (using board relation columns), subtasks (using parent references), and status mapping. Implement proper type conversions and handle null/undefined values gracefully. Ensure all Task Master properties map correctly to Monday.com columns according to the mapping defined in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive unit tests for all transformation functions with various task structures. Test edge cases like empty fields, special characters, and maximum field lengths. Verify bidirectional transformations maintain data integrity. Test with complex task structures including nested subtasks and multiple dependencies. Validate that all Task Master properties are correctly preserved during round-trip transformations.
