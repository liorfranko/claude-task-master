# Task ID: 9
# Title: Update Dependency Management Functions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify dependency tracking functions to use Monday.com board relation columns.
# Details:
Update all dependency management functions to use Monday.com board relation columns. Modify functions that add, remove, or check dependencies to use the Monday.com persistence layer. Implement proper handling of board relation columns for dependency tracking. Create utility functions to validate dependencies and prevent circular references. Update dependency visualization to work with Monday.com data structures. Implement efficient querying of dependencies using Monday.com API filters. Add support for dependency impact analysis when tasks are modified or deleted. Ensure backward compatibility for projects using local persistence.

# Test Strategy:
Test adding, removing, and checking dependencies with various task structures. Verify circular dependency prevention works correctly. Test dependency visualization with Monday.com data. Test dependency impact analysis for task modifications and deletions. Verify backward compatibility with local persistence mode. Create integration tests with a test Monday.com account to verify actual dependency management behavior.
