# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Conflict Resolution Strategies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create conflict resolution mechanisms for handling concurrent updates to the same task.
# Details:
Implement conflict resolution strategies for handling concurrent updates. Create detection mechanisms for identifying conflicting changes. Implement resolution strategies based on configuration: prompt (interactive resolution), latest (last write wins), and manual (preserve both versions). Add support for field-level conflict resolution. Create user interfaces for interactive conflict resolution. Implement conflict logging and reporting. Add telemetry for monitoring conflict frequency and resolution outcomes. Create conflict prevention mechanisms where possible through optimistic locking.

# Test Strategy:
Test conflict detection with various concurrent update scenarios. Verify resolution strategies work correctly for each configuration option. Test field-level conflict resolution. Test user interfaces for interactive resolution. Test conflict logging and reporting. Test conflict prevention mechanisms. Create integration tests with simulated concurrent updates to verify actual conflict resolution behavior.
