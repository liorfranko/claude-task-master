# Task ID: 29
# Title: Validate Monday Integration End-to-End
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 4, 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Perform a thorough end-to-end validation of the Monday.com integration, ensuring all modules interact correctly and data flows seamlessly between the application and Monday.com.
# Details:
Execute comprehensive integration tests covering all major workflows that utilize the Monday.com API client, board manager, and persistence modules. This includes creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting tasks on Monday.com boards, verifying schema compliance, and ensuring robust error handling. Simulate real-world scenarios such as concurrent updates, invalid data submissions, and network failures. Use both API-level tools (e.g., Postman) and UI automation (e.g., Selenium) to validate data synchronization, trigger workflows, and confirm that updates in the application are accurately reflected in Monday.com and vice versa. Document pre-conditions, post-conditions, and test steps using a structured test case template to ensure repeatability and clarity. Collaborate with developers and stakeholders to review test coverage and refine cases as needed for continuous improvement.

# Test Strategy:
1. Prepare a dedicated Monday.com test board with the required schema.
2. Use API testing tools to simulate all CRUD operations and validate API responses for correctness and error handling.
3. Employ UI automation to simulate user workflows, verifying that actions in the application trigger the expected changes in Monday.com.
4. Test edge cases such as invalid data, API failures, and concurrent updates to ensure graceful error handling and data consistency.
5. Review logs and Monday.com board state after each test to confirm expected outcomes.
6. Document all test results, discrepancies, and issues for follow-up.
