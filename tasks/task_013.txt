# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Data Migration Utilities
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create utilities to migrate existing Task Master data to Monday.com and export data back to local files.
# Details:
Develop data migration utilities to facilitate transitioning between local files and Monday.com. Create a `migrateLocalToMonday()` function that transfers all tasks from local JSON files to a Monday.com board. Implement a `migrateMondayToLocal()` function for exporting data back to local files. Add validation tools to verify data integrity during migration. Create progress tracking for long-running migrations. Implement error handling and recovery for failed migrations. Add support for selective migration of specific tasks or projects. Create a migration wizard with clear user guidance. Implement logging and reporting of migration results.

# Test Strategy:
Test migration with various task structures and quantities. Verify data integrity is maintained during migration. Test progress tracking for long-running migrations. Test error handling and recovery for failed migrations. Test selective migration of specific tasks or projects. Test the migration wizard with various user inputs. Create integration tests with a test Monday.com account to verify actual migration behavior.
