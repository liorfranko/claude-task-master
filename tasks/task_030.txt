# Task ID: 30
# Title: Automated Monday Integration Test Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 4, 26, 28
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an automated test suite that continuously validates the Monday.com integration functionality through scheduled test runs and comprehensive coverage reporting.
# Details:
Develop a comprehensive automated testing framework specifically for the Monday.com integration that goes beyond manual testing. Create test scripts that can be run on-demand or scheduled to validate integration health. The suite should include:

1. **Test Runner Framework**: Build a test orchestrator that manages test execution, reporting, and cleanup. Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha to structure tests with proper setup/teardown.

2. **Test Categories**:
   - Unit tests for individual API client methods
   - Integration tests for board manager operations
   - End-to-end workflow tests (create board → add tasks → update → delete)
   - Error handling and edge case validation
   - Performance and rate limiting tests

3. **Test Data Management**: Create utilities for generating test data, managing test boards, and cleaning up after test runs. Implement test isolation to prevent interference between test cases.

4. **Automated Validation**: Include assertions for data integrity, schema compliance, API response validation, and error handling verification. Test both success and failure scenarios.

5. **Reporting and Monitoring**: Generate detailed test reports with coverage metrics, performance benchmarks, and failure analysis. Include logging for debugging failed tests.

6. **CI/CD Integration**: Structure tests to be easily integrated into continuous integration pipelines with proper exit codes and machine-readable output formats.

The test suite should be located in a dedicated `tests/monday-integration/` directory with clear organization by test type and functionality area.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the automated test suite by: 1) Running the complete test suite and confirming all tests pass with proper coverage reporting, 2) Intentionally breaking integration components to ensure tests detect failures correctly, 3) Validating test isolation by running tests multiple times without interference, 4) Checking that test cleanup properly removes all test data from Monday.com, 5) Confirming test reports provide actionable information for debugging failures, 6) Verifying the test suite can be executed in different environments (local, CI/CD) with consistent results, and 7) Testing the suite's ability to handle Monday.com API rate limits and temporary service issues gracefully.
