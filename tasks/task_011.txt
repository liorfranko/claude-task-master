# Task ID: 11
# Title: Update Bulk Operations Functions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify bulk task operations to use batched Monday.com API calls for efficiency.
# Details:
Update all bulk operation functions to use batched Monday.com API calls for efficiency. Modify functions like expand-all and move tasks to use the Monday.com persistence layer. Implement intelligent batching to minimize API calls while respecting rate limits. Create progress tracking for long-running bulk operations. Implement proper error handling and recovery for partially completed bulk operations. Add transaction-like semantics where possible to ensure data consistency. Update return values to provide detailed operation results. Ensure backward compatibility for projects using local persistence.

# Test Strategy:
Test bulk operations with various task quantities. Verify batching works correctly and respects rate limits. Test progress tracking for long-running operations. Test error handling and recovery for partially completed operations. Verify transaction-like semantics maintain data consistency. Test backward compatibility with local persistence mode. Create integration tests with a test Monday.com account to verify actual bulk operation behavior.
