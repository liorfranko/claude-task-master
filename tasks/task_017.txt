# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Error Handling and Recovery System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive error handling system for Monday.com API interactions with recovery mechanisms.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive error handling system for Monday.com API interactions. Create error classification for various API errors (authentication, rate limiting, server errors, etc.). Implement appropriate recovery strategies for each error type. Add retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors. Create fallback mechanisms to use local cache when API is unavailable. Implement user notifications for critical errors. Add detailed error logging with context information. Create error reporting telemetry for monitoring system health. Implement graceful degradation for partial system failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test error handling with various simulated API errors. Verify recovery strategies work correctly for each error type. Test retry logic with various failure scenarios. Test fallback mechanisms when API is unavailable. Test user notifications for critical errors. Test error logging and context information. Test graceful degradation for partial system failures. Create integration tests with simulated API failures to verify actual error handling behavior.
