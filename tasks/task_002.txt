# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Monday Board Manager Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: The Monday Board Manager module is now fully implemented. It provides robust management of Monday.com boards for Task Master, including board creation, schema setup, validation, and migration according to the required 12-column structure. The module supports full CRUD operations, comprehensive schema validation, migration planning, and error handling, and is ready for integration with the Task Master persistence layer.
# Details:
The `monday-board-manager.js` module is complete and located at `scripts/modules/monday-board-manager.js`. It implements all required functionality:

- **Board Creation**: `createProjectBoard()` creates new boards with the Task Master schema.
- **Column Setup**: `setupBoardColumns()` ensures all 12 required columns (Task ID, Description, Status, Priority, Dependencies, Details, Test Strategy, Parent Task, Task Type, Complexity Score, Created By, Assigned To) are present with correct Monday.com types (text, long_text, status, dropdown, numbers, people, etc.).
- **Group Management**: Creates 5 groups (Pending Tasks, In Progress, Completed, Blocked/Deferred, Subtasks), with API limitations detected and handled gracefully.
- **Schema Validation**: `validateBoardSchema()` checks for compliance with the Task Master schema, providing detailed reporting on mismatches or missing columns.
- **Migration Support**: `migrateBoardSchema()` supports both dry-run and live migrations to update board schemas as requirements evolve.
- **Error Handling**: Implements fallback column types and robust error recovery for unsupported or restricted API operations.
- **Utility Functions**: Includes helper functions for common board and column operations.

A comprehensive test suite (`test-monday-board-manager.js`) validates all functionality, including board creation, schema validation, migration, and error handling. Test boards have been created and verified on Monday.com. API limitations regarding group creation are detected and handled by the module.

# Test Strategy:
The test suite covers:
- Board creation with various project names and configurations
- Verification that all 12 required columns are created with correct types and options
- Schema validation against both valid and invalid board structures
- Migration scenarios where columns need to be added or modified, including dry-run and live migrations
- Integration tests with a test Monday.com account to verify actual board creation and management
- Error handling for API limitations (e.g., group creation restrictions)

Test results confirm all features work as intended, with group creation limitations handled gracefully.
