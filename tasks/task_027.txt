# Task ID: 27
# Title: Comprehensive Monday.com Integration Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 4, 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Perform a thorough end-to-end test of the Monday.com integration, covering all supported operations, error handling, and data synchronization scenarios.
# Details:
Design and execute a suite of integration tests that exercise all major Monday.com integration features, including board creation, item CRUD operations, column updates, and synchronization with the Task Master persistence layer. Ensure tests cover both successful and failure scenarios, including authentication errors, rate limiting, and invalid data handling. Use both API-level tools (e.g., Postman, custom scripts) and UI automation (e.g., Selenium) to simulate real-world workflows and verify seamless data flow between Task Master and Monday.com. Incorporate best practices such as queuing requests, respecting rate limits, and validating all API responses. Document all test cases, expected outcomes, and any issues encountered. Coordinate with the documentation and reporting teams to ensure test coverage aligns with integration requirements and user documentation.

# Test Strategy:
1. Set up a dedicated Monday.com test board and configure API credentials.
2. Run automated API tests for all CRUD operations, verifying correct data creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.
3. Simulate error conditions (e.g., invalid tokens, rate limit exceeded) and verify robust error handling and recovery.
4. Use UI automation to trigger integration workflows and confirm correct updates in both Monday.com and Task Master.
5. Validate data synchronization by making changes in both systems and ensuring consistency.
6. Review logs and API responses for anomalies or failures.
7. Document results and confirm all issues are addressed before marking the integration as production-ready.
