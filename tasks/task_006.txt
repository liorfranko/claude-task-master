# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Real-time Sync Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a synchronization engine to handle real-time updates between local state and Monday.com.
# Details:
Develop the `monday-sync-engine.js` module that handles real-time synchronization between local state and Monday.com. Implement the functions specified in the PRD: `syncWithMonday()`, `handleConflictResolution()`, and `validateDataIntegrity()`. Create a background sync process that periodically checks for remote changes based on the configured sync interval. Implement webhook support to receive real-time updates from Monday.com when changes occur. Develop conflict resolution strategies based on the configured approach (prompt, latest, manual). Add support for offline operations with sync-on-reconnect capabilities. Implement a change tracking system to minimize data transfer during sync operations. Add telemetry to monitor sync performance and detect issues.

# Test Strategy:
Test synchronization with various change scenarios (local changes, remote changes, conflicting changes). Verify conflict resolution strategies work as expected. Test offline operation and reconnection behavior. Test webhook handling with simulated Monday.com events. Measure sync performance with various task quantities. Create integration tests with a test Monday.com account to verify actual sync behavior.
