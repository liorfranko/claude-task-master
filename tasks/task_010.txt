# Task ID: 10
# Title: Update Subtask Management Functions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify subtask management functions to use Monday.com items with parent-child relationships.
# Details:
Update all subtask management functions to use Monday.com items with parent-child relationships. Implement the createSubtask() function in the Monday persistence module. Modify functions that add, update, or delete subtasks to use the Monday.com persistence layer. Use the Parent Task board relation column and Task Type dropdown to manage subtask relationships. Implement proper handling of subtask status updates and their impact on parent tasks. Create utility functions to retrieve all subtasks for a given parent task. Update subtask visualization to work with Monday.com data structures. Ensure backward compatibility for projects using local persistence.

# Test Strategy:
Test adding, updating, and deleting subtasks with various parent tasks. Verify parent-child relationships are maintained correctly. Test subtask status updates and their impact on parent tasks. Test retrieving subtasks for a given parent task. Verify subtask visualization works with Monday.com data. Test backward compatibility with local persistence mode. Create integration tests with a test Monday.com account to verify actual subtask management behavior.
