# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create Configuration Management System
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Extend the Task Master configuration system to include Monday.com integration settings and API credentials.
# Details:
Update the configuration management system to support Monday.com integration settings. Modify the `.taskmasterconfig` file structure to include the Monday.com settings as specified in the PRD: boardId, workspaceId, autoSync, syncInterval, and conflictResolution. Add support for environment variables in `.env` for API tokens and workspace IDs. Implement secure storage for API credentials using appropriate encryption or system keychain when available. Create functions to validate configuration and provide helpful error messages for misconfiguration. Add migration support for existing configuration files. Implement functions to toggle between local and Monday.com persistence modes. Create a configuration wizard for initial setup that guides users through the Monday.com integration process.

# Test Strategy:
Test configuration loading with various settings combinations. Verify secure storage of API credentials. Test configuration validation with both valid and invalid configurations. Test migration of existing configuration files. Verify environment variable handling. Test the configuration wizard with various user inputs. Ensure backward compatibility with existing configuration files.
