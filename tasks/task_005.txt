# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create Configuration Management System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Extend the Task Master configuration system to include robust Monday.com integration settings, secure API credential handling, and interactive setup capabilities. The system should support hybrid, local, and Monday.com persistence modes, provide migration from legacy configs, and ensure secure, validated, and user-friendly configuration management.
# Details:
The configuration management system now fully supports Monday.com integration, including:

- Extended `.taskmasterconfig` structure for Monday.com settings: boardId, workspaceId, autoSync, syncInterval, conflictResolution, column/group mapping, and persistence mode (local, monday, hybrid).
- Secure API credential handling: API keys are stored in environment variables and validated during setup.
- Automatic migration from older configuration formats to the new structure.
- Comprehensive configuration validation with detailed error reporting and fallback mechanisms.
- Interactive configuration wizard for guided setup, including API key validation, board/workspace selection, and configuration testing.
- Support for reconfiguration, disabling integration, and status reporting.
- Cache management, retry logic, and robust error handling for all operations.
- All configuration management logic is implemented in `scripts/modules/monday-config-manager.js` and the interactive wizard in `scripts/modules/monday-config-wizard.js`.
- Comprehensive test suite (`test-config-manager.js`) covers all major scenarios and passed all tests.

The system is production-ready and supports all Task Master operations requiring Monday.com integration.

# Test Strategy:
All configuration management features have been validated with a comprehensive test suite:

- Configuration loading and saving with various settings combinations
- Secure storage and validation of API credentials via environment variables
- Configuration validation with both valid and invalid configurations
- Migration of existing configuration files from legacy formats
- Environment variable handling and fallback logic
- Interactive configuration wizard tested with a range of user inputs
- Backward compatibility with existing configuration files
- Status reporting, mapping updates, and integration setup verified

All 8/8 tests passed, confirming system readiness for production use.
