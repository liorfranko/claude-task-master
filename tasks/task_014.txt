# Title: Update CLI Commands for Monday.com Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the CLI interface with new commands for Monday.com board management and migration.
# Details:
Extend the CLI interface with new commands for Monday.com integration as specified in the PRD. Implement `task-master init --monday` for initializing with Monday.com integration. Add `task-master board create` for creating new Monday.com boards. Implement `task-master board link <board-id>` for linking existing boards. Add `task-master migrate local-to-monday` and `task-master migrate monday-to-local` for data migration. Update existing CLI commands to work with both local and Monday.com persistence. Implement proper error handling and user feedback for all commands. Add command completion and help text for new commands. Create interactive prompts for commands requiring multiple inputs.

# Test Strategy:
Test all new CLI commands with various inputs. Verify error handling and user feedback. Test command completion and help text. Test interactive prompts for commands requiring multiple inputs. Test backward compatibility with existing commands. Create integration tests with a test Monday.com account to verify actual command behavior.
