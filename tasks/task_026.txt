# Title: Test Monday.com Integration by Creating a Simple Test Task
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Verify the Monday.com integration by programmatically creating a simple test task on a Monday.com board using the implemented modules.
# Details:
Use the completed Monday.com API client and persistence modules to create a new test item on a designated Monday.com board. Select a board (preferably a dedicated test board) and use the persistence layer's task creation function to add a task with minimal required fields (e.g., Task Name, Status). Ensure the API call uses the correct authentication and handles errors gracefully. Log the response, including the new item's ID, and verify that the item appears on the board. Consider using environment variables for API credentials and board IDs. Reference the official Monday.com API documentation for mutation structure and required fields. Handle rate limits and transient errors with retries as needed. Clean up test data after verification if necessary.[1][2][5]

# Test Strategy:
1. Run the test script to create a new task on the Monday.com test board using the integration modules. 2. Confirm that the API response contains a valid item ID and no errors. 3. Manually verify in the Monday.com UI that the test task appears with the correct details. 4. Check logs for any error messages or failed requests. 5. Optionally, delete the test task after verification to keep the board clean. 6. Repeat the test with invalid data to ensure error handling works as expected.
