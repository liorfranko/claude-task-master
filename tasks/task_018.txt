# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a performance optimization layer with caching, batching, and lazy loading for Monday.com API interactions.
# Details:
Implement a performance optimization layer for Monday.com API interactions. Create an intelligent caching system for frequently accessed data. Implement request batching to minimize API calls. Add lazy loading for large data sets. Create a background prefetching system for anticipated data needs. Implement cache invalidation strategies based on data changes. Add performance monitoring and telemetry. Create adaptive optimization based on usage patterns. Implement memory management for large projects. Add configuration options for controlling optimization behavior.

# Test Strategy:
Test caching with various data access patterns. Verify request batching works correctly and reduces API calls. Test lazy loading with large data sets. Test background prefetching for various usage scenarios. Test cache invalidation with various data change patterns. Test memory management with large projects. Test configuration options for optimization behavior. Measure performance improvements compared to non-optimized implementation.
