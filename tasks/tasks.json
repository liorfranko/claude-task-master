The implementation uses the GraphQL mutation for deleting items, which is available through the Monday.com API. This allows our system to properly synchronize task deletions between our local system and Monday.com boards.\n\nFor deleted items, we've implemented a solution that addresses the limitation in Monday.com's API where there's no direct webhook trigger for item deletion. Instead, we're using a combination of:\n\n1. The `delete_item` mutation in the GraphQL API to perform deletions\n2. Regular synchronization checks to identify deleted items\n3. Proper error handling for cases where items may have been deleted directly in the Monday.com interface\n\nThe implementation maintains consistency between local and Monday.com data stores, with appropriate fallback mechanisms when connectivity issues arise.\n\n### Asynchronous Operation Handling\nAll API calls to Monday.com are properly handled as asynchronous operations with async/await patterns throughout the codebase. This ensures that our application remains responsive while waiting for API responses and properly handles any network latency or temporary connectivity issues.\n\n### Field Mapping and Data Transformation\nThe integration includes comprehensive mapping between our internal task data model and Monday.com's item structure, ensuring that all relevant fields are correctly translated during creation, updates, and deletion operations. This mapping is maintained consistently across all operations to ensure data integrity.\n</info added on 2025-05-31T20:43:38.683Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-31T20:48:26.266Z>\n## Completed Migration: expand-task.js\n\nSuccessfully migrated `expand-task.js` to use the persistence manager:\n\n**Changes Applied:**\n- âœ… Replaced `readJSON`/`writeJSON` imports with `persistenceManager` import\n- âœ… Added `await persistenceManager.initialize(projectRoot, session)` at the start of the function\n- âœ… Replaced `readJSON(tasksPath)` with `await persistenceManager.readTasks(tasksPath, { projectRoot, session })`\n- âœ… Replaced `readJSON(complexityReportPath)` with `await persistenceManager.readTasks(complexityReportPath, { projectRoot, session })` for complexity report reading\n- âœ… Replaced `writeJSON(tasksPath, data)` with `await persistenceManager.writeTasks(tasksPath, data, { projectRoot, session })`\n- âœ… Maintained backward compatibility and error handling\n- âœ… Preserved existing logging and functionality\n\n**Pattern Applied:**\nThis follows the exact same migration pattern established in previous files:\n1.
