# Title: Update MCP Server Tools for Monday.com Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify MCP server tools and direct functions to work with Monday.com persistence.
# Details:
Update all MCP server tools and direct functions to work with Monday.com persistence. Modify MCP functions to use the Monday.com persistence layer instead of local file operations. Update parameter validation for Monday.com constraints. Implement session handling for MCP operations. Add support for Monday.com-specific operations in MCP. Create new MCP functions for Monday.com board management. Update error handling for network-related issues. Ensure backward compatibility for projects still using local persistence. Add telemetry for monitoring MCP operation performance.

# Test Strategy:
Test all modified MCP functions with various inputs. Verify parameter validation works correctly for Monday.com constraints. Test session handling for MCP operations. Test new Monday.com-specific MCP functions. Test error handling for network-related issues. Test backward compatibility with local persistence mode. Create integration tests with a test Monday.com account to verify actual MCP behavior.
